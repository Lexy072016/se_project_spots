**Intro**

This is my Sprint 3 project Spots. In this project I was tasked with recreating the finished project on Figma. I was required to write all the HTML from scratch and write the CSS to go with it.
Spots is a website which allows users to create a profile where they can upload images they prefer to their profiles.
Here is some of the techniques used in my code:
Media Queries to create a smooth interface for different screen types.
Fonts were added and different font weights were used to create more variety throughout the page.
Transitions were used on all of the buttons for interactivity.
Transitions were also added to the modals for a smooth interface when opening and closing the edit profile and new post modals.
Image post can be added and deleted due to added Javascript code.
Profile name and description can be changed by the user for a more personal experience.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
